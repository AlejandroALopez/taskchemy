# Taskchemy: A NextJS app to manage daily tasks and routines

## Overview

During high school and college, I organized my homework and weekly objectives with Excel tables. I used to build such tables, add color, and program my day-to-day. As I was thinking about adding a personal project to my portfolio, one of the first ideas was to improve the way I organized myself.

Thus, I decided to make a website for personal task organization in a month. For the tech stack, I was familiar with React, so I decided to take it a step further by learning NextJS on the fly. I added Tailwind CSS to the mix as well, and MongoDB for the database. By the time I finished making the app, I used Vercel to deploy it.
